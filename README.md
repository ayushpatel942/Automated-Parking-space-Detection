# Project Summary

+ Automated Parking Space Detection: The system uses computer vision techniques implemented in Python with the OpenCV library to process video feeds for detecting vacant and occupied parking spaces in real time. The system emphasizes scalability, cost-effectiveness, and adaptability to varying lighting and environmental conditions.

# Key Features:

1. Manual Parking Space Selection: Users can define parking spaces interactively via a graphical interface.
2. Automated Detection Algorithm: Utilizes grayscale conversion, Gaussian blurring, adaptive thresholding, and pixel counting to assess parking space occupancy with an accuracy of up to 97% in daylight.

# Technologies Used:
+ Programming Languages: Python
+ Libraries/Frameworks: OpenCV, Python's pickle module
+ Techniques: Adaptive Thresholding, Pixel Counting
+ Tools: Video processing through OpenCV's capture functionalities.
